<h2 class="sans">POPULAR SONGS RE-SUNG. "BLAZY BILL; OR, THE BICYCLE CAD."</h2>

<h4><span class="sc">Air</span>&mdash;"<i>Daisy Bell; or, a Bicycle made for Two.</i>"</h4>

<div class="figright" style="width: 350px;"><a href="images/073-800.png"><img src="images/073-350.png" width="350" height="419" alt="BLAZY BILL; OR, THE BICYCLE CAD." /></a></div>

<p>"The churl in nature up and
down" is perennial and ubiquitous.
Like the god Vishnu, he
has many avatars. Every new
development of popular pastime
(for instance) developes its own
particular species of "Cad."
<span class="sc">Leech's</span> "Galloping Snob" of a
quarter of a century ago has been
succeeded by that Jehu of the
"Bike," the Cycling Cad, to
whose endearing manners and
customs in the Queen's highway,
and elsewhere, the long-suffering
pedestrian is persuaded a laggard
Law will shortly have to find its
attention urgently directed. <i>Mr.
Punch</i>, who is of the same opinion,
adapts Mr. <span class="sc">Harry Dacre's</span> popular
song to what he is convinced
will be a popular purpose.</p>

<h2>ROBERT AT GILDALL.</h2>

<p>Ah, wot a change has suddenly
cum over the hold Copperation!
From sitch recepshuns
of Kings and Queens,
and Princes and Princesses,
and Royal Dooks and Dutchesses,
and Zarrowitches and
setterer, and all in their werry
best clothes, too! as I never
witnessed before nor since, to
cum suddenly upon nuffin but
Gog and Magog, is a strikin
fac indeed. As the Rite
onerabel Lord <span class="sc">Mare</span> werry
propperly said, "Ah wot a
fall is here my Country-men!"</p>

<p>And what a blooming staggerer
it was to finish off with
the King and Queen of <span class="sc">Denmark</span>!
of all people in the
World! Why I has allers
been tort to bleeve, from what
I have seen at the Play, that
neether on em wornt not werry
great things as regards behaviour
to the poor <i>Prince
Hamblet</i>, but <span class="sc">Brown</span> says as
that's all over long, long ago,
and isn't to be spoke of no
more, no, not for ever! and
so we must drop it. I think,
upon the hole, as I likes the
<span class="sc">Prince of Wales</span> the best of
all on em, he does allers seem
to enjy hisself so much.</p>

<p>We had him in the City
wunce at Church, and twice at
Gildall to dinner, all in about
a munth, and that ain't so
bad for a near aparrent.
And he does seem allers so
much atome. Why I acshally
overherd him say to our
Blushing Town Clark, after
dining the King of <span class="sc">Denmark</span>,
"How well you have dun it
all, but you allers do it well
at Gildall!"</p>

<p>I wunder how many hundred
sentries it will be before he
says ditto to the Cheerman
of the Country Counsel, poor
feller! after sitch a dinner to
sitch a company? Praps about
another 700! <span class="sc">Robert.</span></p>

<h2 class="sans">THE ADVENTURES OF PICKLOCK HOLES.</h2>

<h4>(<i>By Cunnin Toil.</i>)</h4>

<h3>No. II.&mdash;THE DUKE'S FEATHER.</h3>

<p>Two months had passed without my hearing a word of <span class="sc">Holes</span>.
I knew he had been summoned to Irkoutsk by the <span class="sc">Czar</span> of Russia in
order to help in investigating the extraordinary theft of one of the
Government silver mines, which had completely and mysteriously
disappeared in one night. All the best intellects of the terrible secret
police, the third section of the Government of the Russian Empire, had
exhausted themselves in the vain endeavour to probe this mystery to
the bottom. Their failure had produced a dangerous commotion in
the Empire of the <span class="sc">Czar</span>; there were rumours of a vast Nihilist plot,
which was to shake the Autocracy to its foundations, and, as a last
resource, the <span class="sc">Czar</span>, who had been introduced to <span class="sc">Holes</span> by
<span class="sc">Olga
Fiaskoffskaia</span>, the well-known Russian Secret Agent at the Court
of Lisbon, had appealed to the famous detective to lend his aid in
discovering the authors of a crime which was beginning to turn the
great white <span class="sc">Czar</span> into ridicule in all the bazaars of Central Asia.
<span class="sc">Holes</span>, whose great mind had been lying fallow for some little time,
had immediately consented; and the last I had seen of him was two
months before the period at which this story
opens, when I had said good-bye to him at
Charing-Cross Station.</p>

<p>As for myself, I was spending a week in a
farmhouse situated close to the village of
Blobley-in-the-Marsh. Three miles from the gates of
the farmhouse lay Fourcastle Towers, the ancestral
mansion of Rear-Admiral the Duke of
<span class="sc">Dumpshire</span>, the largest and strangest landowner
of the surrounding district. I had a nodding
acquaintance with His Grace, whom I had once
attended for scarlatina when he was a midshipman.
Since that time, however, I had seen very
little of him, and, to tell the truth, I had made
no great effort to improve the acquaintance. The
Duke, one of the haughtiest members of our
blue-blooded aristocracy, had been called by his
naval duties to all parts of the habitable globe;
I had steadily pursued my medical studies, and,
except for the biennial visit which etiquette demanded,
I had seen little or nothing of the Duke.
My stay at the farmhouse was for purposes of
rest. I had been overworked, that old tulwar
wound, the only memento of the Afghan Campaign,
had been troubling me, and I was glad
to be able to throw off my cares and my black
coat, and to revel for a week in the rustic and
unconventional simplicity of Wurzelby Farm.</p>

<p>One evening, two days after my arrival, I
was sitting in the kitchen close to the fire,
which, like myself, was smoking. For greater
comfort I had put on my old mess-jacket. The
winter wind was whistling outside, but besides
that only the ticking of the kitchen clock disturbed
my meditations. I was just thinking how I should begin
my article on Modern Medicine for the <i>Fortnightly Review</i>, when a
slight cough at my elbow caused me to turn round. Beside me stood
<span class="sc">Picklock Holes</span>, wrapped in a heavy, close-fitting fur <i>moujik</i>. He
was the first to speak.</p>

<div class="figright" style="width: 300px;"><a href="images/076-600.png"><img src="images/076-300.png" width="300" height="481" alt="'Beside me stood Picklock Holes'" /></a>
<p class="center">"Beside me stood Picklock Holes, wrapped
in a heavy, close-fitting fur <i>moujik</i>."</p></div>

<p>"You seem surprised to see me," he said. "Well, perhaps that
is natural; but really, my dear fellow, you might employ your
time to better purpose than in trying to guess the number of
words in the first leading article in the <i>Times</i> of the day before
yesterday."</p>

<p>I was about to protest when he stopped me.</p>

<p>"I know perfectly well what you are going to say, but it is useless
to urge that the country is dull, and that a man must employ his
brain somehow. That kind of employment is the merest wool-gathering."</p>

<p>He plucked a small piece of Berlin worsted&mdash;I had been darning
my socks&mdash;off my left trouser, and examined it curiously. My
admiration for the man knew no bounds.</p>

<p>"Is that how you know?" I asked. "Do you mean to tell me that
merely by seeing that small piece of fancy wool on my trousers you
guessed I had been trying to calculate the number of words in the
<i>Times</i> leader? <span class="sc">Holes</span>, <span class="sc">Holes</span>, will you never cease from
astounding
me?"</p>

<p>He did not answer me, but bared his muscular arm and injected
into it a strong dose of morphia with a richly-chased little gold
instrument tipped with a ruby.</p>

<p>"A gift from the <span class="sc">Czar</span>," said <span class="sc">Holes</span>, in answer to my unspoken
thoughts. "When I discovered the missing silver-mine on board
the yacht of the Grand Duke <span class="sc">Ivanoff</span>, his Imperial Majesty first
offered me the Chancellorship of his dominions, but I begged him
to excuse me, and asked for this pretty toy. Bah, the Russian
police are bunglers."</p>

<p>As he made this remark the door opened and Sergeant <span class="sc">Bluff</span> of
the Dumpshire Constabulary entered hurriedly.</p>

<p>"I beg your pardon, Sir," he said, addressing me, with evident
perturbation; "but would you step outside with me for a moment.
There's been some strange work down at&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p><span class="sc">Holes</span> interrupted him.</p>

<p>"Don't say any more," he broke in. "You've come to tell us
about the dreadful poaching affray in Hagley Wood. I know all
about it, and tired as I am I'll help you to find the criminals."</p>

<p>It was amusing to watch the Sergeant's face. He was ordinarily
an unemotional man, but as <span class="sc">Holes</span> spoke to him he grew purple
with astonishment.</p>

<p>"Beggin' your pardon, Sir," he said; "I didn't know about no&mdash;&mdash;"</p>

<p>"My name is <span class="sc">Holes</span>," said my friend calmly.</p>

<p>"What, Mr. <span class="sc">Picklock Holes</span>, the famous detective?"</p>

<p>"The same, at your service; but we are wasting time. Let us
be off."</p>

<p>The night was cold, and a few drops of rain were falling. As we
walked along the lane <span class="sc">Holes</span> drew from the Sergeant all the
information he wanted as to the number of
pheasants on the Duke's estate, the extent of
his cellars, his rent-roll, and the name of his
London tailor. <span class="sc">Bluff</span> dropped behind after this
cross-examination with a puzzled expression,
and whispered to me:</p>

<p>"A wonderful man that Mister <span class="sc">Holes</span>. Now
how did he know about this 'ere poaching business?
<i>I</i> knew nothing about it. Why I come to
you, Sir, to talk about that retriever dog you lost."</p>

<p>"Hush," I said; "say nothing. It would only annoy
<span class="sc">Holes</span>, and interfere with his inductions.
He knows his own business best." Sergeant
<span class="sc">Bluff</span> gave a grumbling assent, and in another
moment we entered the great gate of Fourcastle
Towers, and were ushered into the hall, where
the Duke was waiting to receive us.</p>

<p>"To what am I indebted for the honour of
this visit?" said his Grace, with all the courtly
politeness of one in whose veins ran the blood
of the Crusaders. Then, changing his tone, he
spoke in fierce sailor-language: "Shiver my
timbers! what makes you three stand there like
that? Why, blank my eyes, you ought to&mdash;&mdash;"
What he was going to say will never be known,
for <span class="sc">Holes</span> dashed forward.</p>

<p>"Silence, Duke," he said, sternly. "We come
to tell you that there has been a desperate poaching
affray. The leader of the gang lies insensible
in Hagley Wood. Do you wish to know who
he was?" So saying, he held up to the now
terrified eyes of the Duke the tail-feather of a
golden pheasant. "I found it in his waistcoat
pocket," he said, simply.</p>

<p>"My son, my son!" shrieked the unfortunate Duke. "Oh
<span class="sc">Alured</span>, <span class="sc">Alured</span>, that it should have come to this!" and he fell
to the floor in convulsions.</p>

<p>"You will find Earl <span class="sc">Mountravers</span> at the cross-roads in Hagley
Wood," said <span class="sc">Holes</span> to the Sergeant. "He is insensible."</p>

<p>The Earl was convicted at the following Assizes, and sentenced to
a long term of penal servitude. His ducal father has never recovered
from the disgrace. <span class="sc">Holes</span>, as usual, made light of the
matter and of his own share in it.</p>

<p>"I met the Earl," he told me afterwards, "as I was walking to
your farmhouse. When he ventured to doubt one of my stories, I
felled him to the earth. The rest was easy enough. Poachers?
Oh dear no, there were none. But it is precisely in these cases that
ingenuity comes in."</p>

<p>"<span class="sc">Holes</span>," I said, "I admire you more and more every day."</p>

<h3>CONNECTED WITH THE PRESS.</h3>

<p><span class="sc">My dear Mr. Punch</span>,&mdash;I see that some
of your contemporaries have got up a "Press
Band" which plays on the Thames Embankment
between one and two o'clock every day
(save Saturday) for the benefit of compositors
out for their dinner-hour. I must confess
that I think the idea excellent, but could it
not be extended? A newspaper consists of
more than "setters up at case." Could not
some entertainment be contrived for the
amusement of editors, theatrical critics, and
city correspondents?</p>

<p>For instance, there are generally a number
of ladies and gentlemen hanging about
Fleet Street in the vain hope of obtaining
interviews with the powers that are in the
world journalistic. A really talented would-be
contributor (especially if a lady) might
"get at" an editor when he was most at his
ease and least on his guard.</p>

<p>I will suppose that the <i>Rédacteur en chef
of the Imperial Universe</i> is seated beside the
Fountain in the Temple, quietly smoking
his cigar. The authoress of "<i>Tiger Songs</i>"
(adapted from the original Norwegian) may
see the Editor from afar off, and come
dancing towards him with the airy gaiety of
a <i>Morgiana</i>. She executes a <i>pas de fascination</i>,
and, when he is completely captivated
by the exquisite grace of her movements,
causes him to seize a bundle of MS.
When she has retired, and the Editor gradually
resumes his normal composure, he discovers
that the authoress of "<i>Tiger Songs</i>"
has left him an article upon "Voyages to
the North Pole." Subjugated by the poetry
of motion, and further moved (almost to
tears) by the soft, sweet strains of the Press
Band, he reads the contribution, and accepts it.</p>

<p>Then recreation, combined with instruction,
might be found for special correspondents
by erecting steam roundabouts on the
Thames Embankment. The "special" might
mount his wooden steed, and career round
and round until he has done a good twenty
miles. Then he would be prepared to give
his experiences, which should (if written in
the proper spirit) be of exceptional value as
"copy."</p>

<p>A thousand details will occur to those who
take an interest in the matter, and may be
filled in at leisure. I merely throw out the
idea, leaving its development to others more
worthy of the task than one who signs himself,
in all humility, <span class="sc">A Pen Plus a Lyre</span>.</p>

<h2 class="sans">THE BRITISH ATHLETE'S VADE-MECUM.</h2>

<ul class="none">
<li><i>Question.</i> What is the <i>specialité</i>
of a Briton?</li>

<li><i>Answer.</i> That given him by
belonging to a race of born
athletes.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> Can any member of the
human family outside the
British Isles do anything in
the shape of sport?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> Only imperfectly. However,
Australians are good at
cricket, and Americans have
been known to adequately
train racehorses.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> Can you give any reason
for their partial success?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> Yes. Australians are our
first-cousins, and Americans
our first-cousins once removed.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> Then you consider them
of the same stock as the true
Briton?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> Quite so. Hence their
prowess in the field.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> What do you think of
foreigners?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> That they are typified
by "Moosoo."</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> When you speak of
"Moosoo," to whom do you
refer?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> To the average French
duffer, who has about as
much knowledge of sport as a
baby in arms.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> Are all foreigners duffers?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> All; without exception.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> How do they go out
shooting?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> With a horn, a <i>couteau
de chasse</i>, a toy game-bag,
and a decorated poodle.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> Can they row at all?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> Not seriously. They can
paddle a little, but have no
more idea of pulling than the
man in the moon.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> And yet, did not a Paris
crew beat a Thames Eight, on
the Seine, early in the present
year?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> Yes; but that was because
there was some good
reason or other for the English
defeat.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> It could not have been,
of course, because the French
Eight was better than their
visitors?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> Certainly not.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> But is not that the view
you would adopt if you were
dealing with two English
crews?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> Why, certainly; but
this was a race between Britons
and Frenchman, and the former
could not naturally be beaten
by the latter on their own
merits.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> Why not?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> Because, as a matter of
fact, they couldn't.</li>

<li><i>Q.</i> And so your opinion of
the superiority of Britons over
foreigners is unalterable?</li>

<li><i>A.</i> Of course. I should
not be a Briton if it were
not so.</li>

<p>The <span class="sc">Home Secretary</span> was seated in his room awaiting the arrival
of the Deputation:&mdash;</p>

<p>"Well, I suppose I was right to allow them to interview me," he
murmured. "The submerged Tenth have not the franchise to-day.
Ah! but they may have it to-morrow!"</p>

<p>The <span class="sc">Home Secretary's</span> exclamation was caused by the appearance
of a number of half-starved ragamuffins, who had lounged into the room,
and were now standing respectfully before him.</p>

<p>"Beg pardon, Sir," said the spokesman of this strange-looking
deputation, "but are you the <span class="sc">'Ome Seckkerterry</span>?"</p>

<p>"That is my position," replied the Cabinet Minister. "And now
that you are here, what do you want?"</p>

<p>"Well, Guv'nor, truth to tell, we are out of employment. Our
trade has gone to the dogs. Our business wos a removin' of superfluous
cash from the pockets of the more inattentive of the public."</p>

<p>"Burglars!" exclaimed the <span class="sc">Home Secretary</span>, in some alarm,
and he hastily approached the handle of the bell communicating
with the Messenger's Room.</p>

<p>"Stow it!" cried the spokesman roughly, then hurriedly lowering
his tone, he apologised, and said he spoke from force of habit.
"Twenty years ago our purfession was worth something. We could
make a tidy living out of silk pocket-handkerchiefs, and sich like.
But nowadays it's all changed. It wants capital, Guv'nor; that's
where it is, it wants capital!"</p>

<p>"What wants capital?" queried the Minister.</p>

<p>"Why, our purfession, to be sure. Nowadays everythink's done
on scientific principals. A burglar must know something of
chemistry, and be up in things generally. Besides, all the real
good things are worked by syndicates. Unless you can put in a
'underd pounds or so, why, you are nowhere. What are we to
do?"</p>

<p>The <span class="sc">Home Secretary</span> sat in deep thought.</p>

<p>"Look 'ere, Guv'nor," continued the spokesman, "'ere's a noshun.
As we can't afford to be thieves, and haven't sufficient education to
become burglars, why shouldn't we assist the Civil Power? Make
us Peelers, Sir, you know&mdash;Coppers."</p>

<h3>EXTRACTED FROM THE DIARY OF TOBY, M.P.</h3>

<p><i>House of Commons, Monday, August 7.</i>&mdash;House brisked up to-day
on approaching Report Stage Home-Rule Bill; over three hundred
Members present, including <span class="sc">Joseph</span>, fresh from Birmingham; on
whole, a melancholy gathering. At outset every appearance of collapse.
Influence of Bank Holiday over it all. Ministers who
should have been in places to answer questions not arrived. Worse
still when Home-Rule Bill reached, and new Clauses called on.
Turned out <span class="sc">Prince Arthur</span> was still dallying at Dulwich,
<span class="sc">Heneage</span> 'appy at 'Ampstead, <span class="sc">Wolmer</span> tarrying by the giddy
swing on Peckham Rye. <span class="sc">Bartley</span>, ever ready to sacrifice himself
in interests of Empire, proposed to move new Clauses for absentees,
but <span class="sc">Speaker</span> wouldn't have it; so passed on to <span class="sc">Parker Smith</span>.
P. S., as sometimes happens in correspondence, proved most important
part of letter. He had quite a cluster of Clauses; moved
them in succession through long and dreary night.</p>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page83" id="page83"></a>[pg 83]</span>

<div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;"><a href="images/083-1500.png"><img src="images/083-600.png" width="600" height="441" alt="Holiday Time--;as shown by Members' dress in the House." /></a>
<h3 class="sans">HOLIDAY TIME&mdash;AS SHOWN BY MEMBERS' DRESS IN THE HOUSE.</h3></div>

<span class="pagenum"><a name="page84" id="page84"></a>[pg 84]</span>

<p>Incidentally provided <span class="sc">Tim Healy</span> with opportunity for making
speech quite in old (of late unfamiliar) form. One of P. S.'s clauses
designed for appointment of Boundary Commissioners, with view of
what <span class="sc">T. W. Russell</span> described as "ojus jerrymandering." <span class="sc">Tim</span>
declared that scheme proposed by Bill would give Unionists a much
larger representation than they were entitled to, leaving them, with
exception of disfranchisement of Dublin University, in very
much same numbers as they now stand. Demonstrating this,
<span class="sc">Tim</span> cited in detail the constituencies affected. Totted them up
to reach the total he had affirmed&mdash;certainly eighteen, possibly
twenty-one.</p>

<p>"There's Armagh two," he said, "and Antrim four. Four and two
are six," he added, turning with defiant look upon the placid figure
of <span class="sc">T. W. Russell</span>. Paused for a moment to give full opportunity
for anyone getting up to deny this proposition. No response;
<span class="sc">Tim</span> proceeded; "Very well, six. There's Belfast four. Six and
four are ten!" he shouted triumphantly, looking across at <span class="sc">Joseph</span>.
"Very well, ten," he added, in low growl; evidently disappointed
at lack of spirit in camp opposite. "Down&mdash;North, East and West
Down you'll have, I suppose? That's three. Three and ten's
thirteen. Thirteen!" he shouted, turning with quick flush of hope
in direction of seat of <span class="sc">Edward of Armagh</span>. But Colonel not there.
In fact not been seen in House since he went out after the great
fight, holding bunch of keys to his bruised cheek.</p>

<p>Things looking desperate; still <span class="sc">Tim</span> plodded on. Surely age of
chivalry not so finally gone that there was not left in an Irish bosom
sufficient courage to deny to a political adversary that two and two
made four? Perhaps <span class="sc">Tim</span> had been piling on the units too high.
He would continue on a lower scale. "Very well, that's thirteen.
Now North Fermanagh's one. Thirteen and one's fourteen." No
pen can describe the acrimony <span class="sc">Tim</span> threw into this proposition.
Still the craven blood did not stir. "Londonderry, North, South,
and City&mdash;I suppose you expect to collar them all? That's three;
fourteen and three are seventeen."</p>

<p>It was terrible. The <span class="sc">Speaker</span>, fearing bloodshed, interposed, ruling
<span class="sc">Tim</span> out of order; only just in time. One could see by flush on
<span class="sc">Macartney's</span> cheek that one step more would have been fatal, and
that the proposition "Seventeen and two are nineteen" would have
led to outbreak beside which the "regrettable incident" would have
been meretriciously mild.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Took up Report Stage of Home-Rule Bill.</p>

<p class="center">"Bimetallism."</p></div>

<p><i>Tuesday.</i>&mdash;The Squires had regular set-to to-night. He of
Blankney began it; <span class="sc">Squire of Malwood</span>, never loath for a tussle,
cheerfully stepping into the ring. Order of the day was Report Stage
of Home-Rule Bill. Members, though in languid mood, prepared
once more to tread the dreary round, to pass a summer night</p>

<div class="poem">  <div class="stanza">
<p>In dropping buckets into empty wells,</p>
<p>And growing old in drawing nothing up.</p>
  </div>  </div>

<p><span class="sc">Squire of Blankney</span> ordered matters otherwise. Has for some
time had by him paper on Bimetallism, which he desired to
read to House. Thought event might have come off on Vote on Account;
ruled out of order; would fit in equally well on Indian Budget.
But when will Indian Budget be taken? <span class="sc">Gorst</span> and Echo answer
"When?" <span class="sc">Squire</span>, whilst willing to sacrifice all personal considerations
on the altar of public interest, feels that duty to his
Queen and country call him away for an interval of rest. He might
leave his paper for <span class="sc">Dicky Temple</span> to read; or he might have it
printed and circulated with the votes. Whilst pondering on these
alternatives, happy thought came to him. Why not move adjournment
of House, and so work off speech? Of course wouldn't do to
put the matter bluntly, and "ask leave to move the adjournment
for the purpose of discussing a definite matter of urgent public importance,
namely, <span class="sc">Harry Chaplin's</span> desire to get out of town."
But for "<span class="sc">Harry Chaplin's</span> desire," &amp;c., substitute "the closing
of the Indian mints to the free coinage of silver," and there you
are.</p>

<p>There we were indeed. Opposition didn't show up with the
enthusiasm that might have been expected in such a cause.
Question was indeed raised whether the necessary forty Members
had risen to support application for leave. <span class="sc">Speaker</span> said it was all
right, so <span class="sc">Squire of Blankney</span> brought out his treasured manuscript
and reeled off his speech. <span class="sc">Squire of Malwood</span> exceedingly
angry that he should have occupied nearly an hour for the purpose.
So angry that he took almost precisely same time in replying.
Drew a lurid picture of the other Squire going about
"endeavouring to make mischief in Hindustan."
The poor <span class="sc">Squire of Blankney</span>! No such fell design had filled
his manly breast. He was guilty of no more direful purpose
than that of availing himself of forms of the House to read a
paper on Bimetallism prepared for a lapsed
occasion, which might have been out of date had he kept it in his
drawer till he came back from his holiday. It led to appropriation
of four hours of the sitting; but if they had not been
wasted in this way, they would have been squandered in some other,
and House would have lost spectacle of this set-to between the
<span class="sc">Malwood Mauler</span> and the <span class="sc">Blankney Pet</span>.</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;None to speak of.</p>

<p><i>Thursday.</i>&mdash;Seems <span class="sc">Brodrick</span> didn't say at Farnham those naughty
things about Mr. G. 'Tis true he had referred to failure of a
popular local donkey to win a race owing to increasing infirmities,
adding "it is quite time some of us should be turned out to grass."
But he was not thinking of Mr. G. Of whom then was the Young

<p>Certainly nothing in Mr. G.'s appearance to-night suggestive of
desire or necessity for knocking-off work. Others may tire and
turn fondly to contemplation of moor, river, or sea. Mr. G. thinks
there's no place like London in mid-August, no scene so healthful or
invigorating as House of Commons. Plunged in to-night on one of
the interminable Amendments. A difficult job in hand. Had to
accept Amendment which <span class="sc">Solicitor-General</span> and <span class="sc">Attorney-General</span>
had an hour earlier been put up to show was impossible.
Began by pummelling <span class="sc">Prince Arthur</span>; proceeded to make little of
<span class="sc">Henry James</span>; turned aside to pink <span class="sc">Joseph</span> with sarcastic
reference
to inveterate love with which he is cherished in the bosom of his new
friends the Tories; finished by throwing over <span class="sc">Attorney-General</span>
with grace and dexterity that made experience rather pleasant than
otherwise; and at a quarter to eight accepted an Amendment that
had been moved at a quarter to six.</p>

<p>It was in conversation round this Debate that <span class="sc">Solicitor-General</span>,
accused by <span class="sc">Carson</span> of knowing all about a certain point of law,
delighted House by taking off wig, pitching it ceiling-high, deftly
catching it, and observing with a wink at <span class="sc">Speaker</span>, "No, I'm hanged if I do."</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Report Stage Home-Rule Bill.</p>

<p><i>Friday Night.</i>&mdash;Grouse to-morrow, Home-Rule Bill to-night.
As <span class="sc">Borthwick</span> says, Home-Rule Bill is like partridge, at least to
this extent, that, in course of a few months, its daily appearance on
the table leads to sensation of palled palate. Truly, <i>toujours
perdrix</i> is endurable by comparison with Always Home Rule.
Members who remain bear up pretty bravely, but glance wistfully
at the door through which have disappeared so many friends and
companions dear, bound Northward. The holiday, even when it
comes for us&mdash;the mere residuum, tasting grouse only from the
bounty of our friends, who are not dead but gone before&mdash;will be
but an interval in a prodigiously long Session. "I suppose you
find the Autumn Session very popular," I said to <span class="sc">Marjoribanks</span>,
who still wears a smile. "Yes," he said; "more especially with
Members who have paired up to Christmas."</p>

<p><i>Business done.</i>&mdash;Still harping on Home Rule.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.



*** START: FULL LICENSE ***

THE FULL PROJECT GUTENBERG LICENSE
PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK

To protect the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at
http://gutenberg.org/license).


Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the
phrase "Project Gutenberg" appears, or with which the phrase "Project
Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere at no cost and with
almost no restrictions whatsoever.  You may copy it, give it away or
re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included
with this eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org

1.E.2.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is derived
from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

1.E.4.  Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

1.E.5.  Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6.  You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any
word processing or hypertext form.  However, if you provide access to or
distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format other than
"Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official version
posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site (www.gutenberg.org),
you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a

form.  Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg-tm
License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

1.E.7.  Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,
performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg-tm works
unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

access to or distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works provided
that

- You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
     the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
     you already use to calculate your applicable taxes.  The fee is
     owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he
     has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the
     Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.  Royalty payments
     must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you
     prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax
     returns.  Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and
     sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the
     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

- You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or
     destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium
     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

- You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any
     money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
     electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days
     of receipt of the work.

- You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
     distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9.  If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set
forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from
both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and Michael
Hart, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark.  Contact the
Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
